                In keeping with the legacy of Shackleton and the climate crisis that our planet is facing; we see school engagement as a critical part of this expedition. Our online outreach program, which can be accessed via <a href="https://www.liketobe.org/groups/antarcticquest21/profile" target="_blank">LikeToBe.org</a> will enable students, teachers, and parents the ability to follow our expedition for latest updates, discuss topics online with the team, accesses recourses and activities.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to engage with a minimum of 100 schools and invite those schools to join us online and become ambassadors for Antarctica. Our fundraising and your support, will help continue this outreach work long after the expedition is over, creating a fitting legacy to the project.
