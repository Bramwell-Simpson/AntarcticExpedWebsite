            <h3 class="black title u-text-center">What Connects You, Your Organisation, Your Grandchildren and Sir Ernest Shackleton?</h3>

            <p>
                With this question, I invite you to come and learn about our expedition and meet the team that will step into untrodden territory for science and exploration, and to commemorate our Polar Hero, Sir Ernest Shackleton.
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer to the question above may seem obvious: in an age of widespread pollution and climate change, the world that children will experience, is going to be determined by the wisdom of our decisions today. It is, therefore, key that these decisions should be founded on scientific knowledge. Scientific research is fundamental to our world view and to allowing us to use innovation, and technology to deal with issues that we may have unwittingly created, that are to our detriment as a species.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sir Ernest Shackleton was one of the pioneers of scientific research in Antarctica, a region now recognised as important to global climate regulation. His scientific legacy is unfinished and often under-valued. During our expedition, we will pay tribute to Shackleton with a ceremony on the ice and honour his memory 100 years after his passing, by continuing the scientific exploration his ‘Quest’ expedition could not complete.
            </p>

            <img class="u-center" src="images/BlogImages/crowdfunder01.jpg" alt="Crowd Funding Image">

            <p>
                We are going to Antarctica to conduct cutting-edge research into climate change and micro-plastic pollution. This will be combined with an outreach programme to educate, inspire and empower people to live more sustainable lives and also protect this last pristine wilderness.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Come and join us for an entertaining hour between 12.30 – 13.30 on 9th June 2021; learn about our plans and how you can follow our expedition. There will be an opportunity to contribute to our expedition, to support our educational outreach programme and Community interest activities. We are seeking to raise funds to support our essential equipment purchases and also to allow us to run our legacy education programme.

                We have a number of special items which are on offer for sale; including bottles of the Whisky Shackleton favoured and signed by his Granddaughter, the Hon. Alexandra Shackleton. However, most of all, we want to enthral you with our stories and footage of the unforgiving and incredibly hostile environment we are going to operate in, to push the bounds of Antarctic science with means only available to such rare, man-hauled expeditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Details for joining us will be promulgated on the morning of 9th June 2021 on this Blog Page, but you can learn about our prizes as we go forward from this weekend. You will also be able to look at videos linked to our expedition on the same page.  We really look forward to meeting you on 9th June for a fun filled Lunch hour.

                    Please help us. We need to smash this Crowdfunder to get the money for this historic trip. You can be part of it by donating, by buying a reward and by letting your friends, families and contacts know about what we are trying to achieve. It can be large or small. Together we can do this. You can be part of making history. Your investment in what we are doing - both literally and metaphorically - will make sure that the centenary of Shackleton's Final Quest goes down in the history books: where it deserves to be. Thank you so much in advance for all your help and for being part of our team too.

            <h2 class="black title u-text-center">Why Did Antarctic Explorer Ernest Shackleton Keep ‘Conking Out’?</h2>
            <p>
                Shackleton’s entire Antarctic career was marked by strange episodes of weakness, breathlessness, and other incapacitating symptoms. His near-superhuman feats coexisted, according to expedition notes, with an occasional inability to stand on his own. While his early death has been widely attributed to heart disease brought on by years of heavy smoking, Shackleton’s intermittent bouts of weakness in his youth have intrigued historians, doctors, and armchair medical detectives for decades. </p> <p>Antarctic Quest team however will do things differently. Due to the physical demands of the expedition, the deployment team will be consuming a high calorie diet, containing macro and micronutrients to support health, performance and recovery. In addition, the team will be taking supplements where needed, to avoid potential deficiencies which may lead to fatigue or any other symptoms.

                <a href="https://www.ecomagazine.com" target="_blank">ECO Magazine</a> – ‘ECO’ for ‘Environment Coastal & Offshore’ – reports news of ocean science, innovation, technology and exploration to an international audience of governments and policymakers, as well as professionals and NGOs within the global maritime community. For the launch of the <a href="https://www.oceandecade.org/" target="_blank">United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development</a>, it partnered with The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (<a href="https://ioc.unesco.org" target="_blank">IOC-UNESCO</a>) to publish a digital special edition showcasing initiatives, knowledge and solutions relevant to the seven Ocean Decade outcomes. These include ‘<strong>a predicted ocean</strong>’, relating to our capacity to understand ocean conditions, forecast their change and relationship to human wellbeing and livelihoods. It is this category, to which Antarctic Quest 21 will contribute and we are delighted to announce the publication of our article ‘<strong><i>What is your next step against climate change?</i></strong>‘ in the special edition on 17th May 2021.

            <h2 class="black title u-text-center">Our Footprint – Our Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
                Today, 22 April 2021, is <a href="https://www.earthday.org" target="_blank">Earth Day</a> – what a better day to take responsibility and launch our footprint audit!
            </p>
            <p>
                Collectively, humankind use the ecological resources as if we had 1.73 planets, which means that each year
                sometime in August, we exceed the Earth’s capacity to regenerate what we use or damage in terms of soil, water,
                agriculture, fisheries, forests and so on …) in one year. Anything we collectively do after this ‘<a href="https://www.overshootday.org" target="_blank">Overshoot Day</a>’ is not
                sustainable with respect to the biocapacity of our planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to these ecological resources, we extract natural resources, our ‘<a href="https://friendsoftheearth.uk/consumption-natural-resources" target="_blank">material footprint</a>’, the tonnage of materials extracted to generate our consumer goods (raw materials from which we derive petrochemicals, metals, fertiliser and so on…).
            </p>
            <p>
                We also generate huge amounts of waste, ranging from the obvious and very visible (e.g. domestic, food and electronic waste, sewage) to the more obscure or invisible (e.g. greenhouse gases, microfibers, pre-consumer industrial waste).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Antarctic Quest 21 team are preparing for an expedition that supports very important climate and pollution research. But we are also using resources that would have otherwise remained untouched, including
                <ul>
                    <li>energy for global communication, transport and information technology</li>
                    <li>equipment, instrumentation, specific expedition clothing and food</li>
                    <li>hosting information and education events</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The least we can do is to find out and be honest about the footprint of Antarctic Quest 21. This process will call upon the whole team for information over the next weeks and months and hopefully lead to practical actions that reduce our expedition footprint and mitigate the remainder.
            </p>
            <p>
                I fully expect that our sustainability audit will also feed into our personal lives: it will teach us all how we can reduce our everyday footprint. Overshoot Day is not someone else’s problem, and Antarctic Quest 21 leadership is about so much more than completing the scientific mission and bringing back the team safely from Antarctica. We are going to share our insights with you.
