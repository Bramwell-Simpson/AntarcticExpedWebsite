        <h1 id="expedInfo" class="black title u-text-center">Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            It was in 1820 that Lt Edward Bransfield Royal Navy, made the first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica. 
            That first sighting, 200 years ago, was the start of a period of intensive exploration of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica itself. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The late 1800’s and early 1900’s saw the ‘Heroic Age’ of Polar Exploration. Outstanding in their personal contributions to this period, were the British explorers Sir Ernest Shackleton and Sir Robert Falcon Scott. 
            However, the Heroic age of Polar Exploration had other great contributors from across the globe. Figures such as Roald Amundsen and Douglas Mawson, were instrumental in unlocking the interior of the Antarctic Continent. 
            Others, like Jean-Baptiste Charcot, who Scott liked, collaborated with and referred to as ‘The Gentleman of the Pole,’ explored the Coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. 
            Each, in their own way, undertook incredible challenges; seeking to forge into regions that had not been explored before.
            As well as their efforts to tread where no one else had stood before, they also contributed immensely to the global pool of scientific knowledge.
            In particular, Scott and Mawson sought to benefit mankind by undertaking comprehensive scientific projects. 
            All these individuals though, displayed the most outstanding levels of resilience, leadership, commitment, endurance, and exceptional vision. 
            It could be argued though, that the person who epitomised this more than any other figure, was Sir Ernest Shackleton or, as he was better known, ‘The Boss’.
            Despite the tribulations he suffered as a result of the loss of his ship ‘Endurance’ in the Weddell Sea in 1915 and his heroic battle to return all his team to safety, 
            which saw him endure nine months of the most extreme hardships imaginable, he returned to the Antarctica in 1921 to lead a scientific expedition. 
            Sadly, Shackleton’s ‘Quest’ Expedition was never to begin in earnest as he suffered a fatal heart attack on the morning of 5 January 1922. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the values of the heroes of the Golden Age of Antarctic exploration, but most importantly a commemoration to that inspirational figure Sir Ernest Shackleton, 
            in the 100th Anniversary of his passing, that now inspire ‘Expedition Antarctic Quest 21’.

        <h1 id="background" class="black-title u-text-center">Background</h1>
        <p>In 2012, Paul Hart led a small team to cross the Antarctic Peninsula from West to East and back; undertaking scientific research to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of Captain Scott reaching the South Pole. 
            Man-hauling loads of more than 110kg, the team braved tremendous storms and the ever-present dangers of crevasse, and avalanche. 
            Katabatic winds gusting more than 100mph threatened to destroy their tents and took temperatures as low as -55C. The team also had to deal with the mental impact of continuous falls into the crevasses. 
            Despite this, for over two and half months they explored un-trodden areas of the Antarctic Peninsula and gained valuable data relating to climate change, geology and meteorology. 
            Their work was hailed as an outstanding success by such venerable institutions as the British Antarctic Survey, the Scott Polar Research Institute and the National Environmental Research Council.

        <h1 class="black title u-text-center">The purpose</h1>     
        <p>
            Following on from the success of the 2012 ‘Spirit of Scott’ Expedition, 
            the intention is now to continue the science and exploration programme on the Antarctic Peninsula by travelling over and then along the spine of the Antarctic Peninsula.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 201<sup>st</sup> Anniversary year of the discovery of Antarctica, the team will cross the Forbidden Plateau from Portal Point to Foyn Point and emplace, and start a GPS data gathering device to measure the movement of the Peninsula bedrock.
            This will provide information on how the thickness of the ice covering the rock is changing. The team will then travel down the spine of the Peninsula and continue their data gathering, 
            to contribute to the scientific understanding of what is happening on the Peninsula in terms of climate change, meteorology, geology and glaciology; all things that have a direct impact on the future of our planet and every one of us.
            Of special importance will be the teams research into microplastics and metal contamination of the snow on the Peninsula, revealing just how we are affecting Antarctica. 
            Like earlier pioneers to Antarctica, the team want to inform, educate and inspire the general public on the subject of Antarctica. 
            To these ends there will be a comprehensive educational outreach programme that will work with schools, universities and the general public to broaden knowledge and understanding about Antarctica.
        </p>
        <p class="u-text-left">The Team will conduct the following science projects;
            <ul class="u-text-left">
                <li>Gather snow samples from remote locations to measure microplastic contamination</li>
                <li>Take Magnetotelluric measurements to determine the subsurface conductivity and composition of the Peninsula</li>
                <li>Measure UV Radiation levels across the Peninsula to look at Ozone depletion and the impact on bio-mass in the Antarctic waters</li>
                <li>Emplace and set to work a GPS system to measure movement of the Antarctic Peninsula</li>
                <li>Measure snow deposition rates to look at Climatic changes on the Peninsula</li>
                <li>Undertake Meteorological Observations in remote locations to identify changing weather patterns</li>
                <li>Measure metallic contamination of the snow to determine metal fall out into the Southern Ocean and its impact on bio-mass in the water column.</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="col-6">
            This isn’t Polar Tourism or a trip based on gratification of the egos of the expedition team. This expedition is all about giving something back; it is about highlighting the values and the spirit of the heroic pioneers of Antarctic Exploration. 
            It is also about undertaking a journey that will allow the team to contribute to the scientific understanding of what is happening in Antarctica and what this means to every one of us.
            And, finally, it is about extending that knowledge to future generations so that they may also be inspired by the science and adventure of what our forebears have done.
